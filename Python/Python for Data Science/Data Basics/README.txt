Script Breakdown:
1. Data Loading and Inspection:
	- Load a dataset (in this case, Boston Housing data).
	- Check for missing values and display basic statistics.
2. Data Cleaning:
	- Visualize outliers using box plots for each feature.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	- Generate a correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.
	- Use joint plots to explore relationships between features.
4. Data Preprocessing:
	- Select important features based on their correlation with the target variable.
	- Split data into training and testing sets.
5. Model Building:
	- Build a simple Linear Regression model.
	- Predict and evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
6. Visualization:
	- Plot actual vs. predicted values to visually assess model performance.
7. Advanced Analysis:
	-Use Statsmodels to check the statistical significance of each feature in the linear model.
